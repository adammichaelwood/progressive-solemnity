> Do not stand and stare in wonder unto the sky above.  
> You have seen the wondrous glory of the risen Lord of Love,  
> and just as you have seen Him ascend into the skies  
> So shall the living savior return before your eyes.  
> Alleluia! Alleluia! We praise our God and King!  
> Alleluia, alleluia, Your people ever sing!  

> On his throne in highest heaven our Savior takes His place,  
> now and always on the Mercy Seat, the source of endless grace.  
> Though not only there we seek Him; never far from us is He.  
> We know the Lord is with us, if we have faith to see.  
> Neither staring up in wonder, nor hiding like the dead,  
> we will find Him here together in breaking of the bread.

> All you servants of the Most High now sing and clap your hands,  
> For the Lord that once was crucified is Prince of all the lands.  
> Sound the trumpet, sing together, as our Savior mounts His throne,  
> And hear the voice that calls us a people of His own.  
> Alleluia to the Father and to His only Son,  
> Alleluia to the Spirit, Eternal Three in One! 
>
