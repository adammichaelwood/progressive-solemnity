We believe in one Lord, <i>Je</i>sus **Christ**,  
the only _Son_ of **God**,  
\* eternally begotten _of_ the **Father**,  

God from God, _Light_ from **Light**,  
true God _from_ true **God**,  
begot<i>ten</i>, not **made**,  
of one Being _with_ the **Father**.  
\* Through him all _things_ were **made**.  

For us \[men\] and for _our_ sal<b>vation</b>  
he came _down_ from **heaven**:  
by the power of the <i>Ho</i>ly **Spirit**  
he became incarnate from the <i>Vir</i>gin **Mary**,  
\* and _was_ made **man**.  

\[ was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the <i>Vir</i>gin **Mary** \]  
\[ \* and became <i>tru</i>ly **human**. \]  

For our sake he was crucified under <i>Pon</i>tius **Pilate**;  
\* he suffered death _and_ was **buried**.  

On the third day he _rose_ a<b>gain</b>  
in accordance _with_ the **Scriptures**;  
he ascended <i>in</i>to **heaven**  
\* and is seated at the right hand _of_ the **Father**.  

He will come a<i>gain</i> in **glory**  
to judge the living _and_ the **dead**,  
\* and his kingdom will _have_ no **end**.  

We believe in the <i>Ho</i>ly **Spirit**,  
the Lord, the giv<i>er</i> of **life**,  
\* who proceeds from the Father _and_ the **Son**.  
\[ \* who proceeds _from_ the **Father**. \]

With the Father _and_ the **Son**  
he is wor<i>shiped</i> and **glorified**.  
\* He has spoken _through_ the **Prophets**.  

\[ Who with the Father _and_ the **Son** \]  
\[ is wor<i>shiped</i> and **glorified**, \]  
\[ \* who has spoken _through_ the **Prophets**. \]  

We believe in one holy catholic and apo<i>stol</i>ic **Church**.  
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgive<i>ness</i> of **sins**.  
We look for the resurrection _of_ the **dead**,  
\* and the life of the _world_ to **come**.
