title: Young People and Traditional Liturgy
summary: Are you sure you have a traditional liturgy?
---

If you think "young people" don't come to your church because you have "traditional liturgy" (and, therefore, need to replace it with something more contemporary), I suggest you first examine what you think is actually going on at your parish.

Four crusty hymns played too slowly is not traditional.
