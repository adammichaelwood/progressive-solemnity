## Prayer invoking St. Isidore of Seville --- Patron of the Internet and Computers

Almighty and eternal God,  
who created us in Thy image  
and bade us to seek after all  
that is good, true and beautiful,  
especially in the divine person  
of Thy only-begotten Son,  
our Lord Jesus Christ,  

grant, we beseech Thee that,  
through the intercession of Saint Isidore,  
bishop and doctor,  
during our journeys through the internet  
we will direct our hands and eyes  
only to that which is pleasing to Thee  
and treat with charity and patience  
all those souls whom we encounter.  

Through Christ our Lord.  
Amen.

## Prayer to St. Jude --- Patron Saint of Hopeless Causes

Blessed Jude ---

The internet is hopeless.  
Computers are notoriously buggy.
All software is poorly designed,  
and badly coded.

Moreover, users are stupid,  
and will ever remain so.

We would ask for your help in this matter, but we're all pretty sure that you should spend your time on more important things like that hospital they named after you.

But if you run into Job,
tell him we totally know  
exactly how he feels.

Amen.
